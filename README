AI2 Challenge
=============

This project contains my solution to a challenge presented during the interview
process for the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2). The challenge
was as follows:
> You are given a dictionary file, with one word per line. Write a
> program that takes as input one or more words, and for each input
> word, print out all anagrams of the input word that appear in the
> dictionary. An anagram of a word is any word you can form by permuting
> the letters of the input word. For example, the word "stab" is an
> anagram of "bats", as is "tabs". Please include documentation for
> running your program. Try to make it easy-to-use and efficiently
> implemented.
